Available Methods for 3D Scene Design/Modification:
We have four methods to design or modify a 3D scene, each with different strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to select the most effective method for the current iteration based on the user's prompt and the existing scene data.

Method 1: Load real2sim indoor scene data
  Data Prior: Yes
  Supported Room Types: Living room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, office, and classroom.
  Use Case: Ideal for generating foundational layouts for common room types.
  Strengths: Provides a ready-made, realistic layout based on real-world data. Easy to implement.
  Weaknesses: Limited room type diversity compared to other methods.

Method 2: Scene synthesis by neural network
  Data Prior: Yes
  Model: Trained on the 3D Front indoor dataset.
  Supported Room Types: Living room, bedroom, and dining room.
  Use Case: Creates a foundational layout for common room types.
  Strengths: Fast and flexible, making it ideal for rapid scene prototyping. Offers diverse configurations for living room, bedroom, and dining room.
  Weaknesses: Less accurate compared to method 1 (real2sim) and other more data-driven methods.

Method 3: Image generation + 3D reconstruction
  Data Prior: 2D image prior
  Use Case: Suitable for generating detailed partial scenes or completing specific room sections.
  How It Works: We use Stable Diffusion to generate images, then apply 3D reconstruction techniques to convert the image into a full 3D scene.
  Strengths: Excellent for adding a group of objects on the top of a furniture.(e.g., enriching a tabletop).
  Weaknesses: More time-consuming and complex than other methods. Not as effective for generating the entire scene or layout.

Method 4: Generated Scene with GPT
  Data Prior: LLM prior
  Room Type Diversity: Not limited to any specific room types.
  Use Case: Recommended for room types that are not supported by methods 1 or 2 (e.g., more niche or custom room types).
  Strengths: Highly versatile and capable of generating scenes for any room type. Flexible with respect to room design and customization. Also expert in adding a single object (e.g., add a cup on the table or a book on the shelf).
  Weaknesses: May not be as real or accurate as data-driven methods.

Method 5: Update Scene with GPT
  Data Prior: LLM prior
  Room Type Diversity: Works with all room types.
  Use Case: Best for refining layouts by adjusting object placement or removing redundant elements when the existing arrangement is suboptimal.
  Strengths: Highly flexible and adaptable to various room designs. Excels at modifying or removing specific objects (e.g., repositioning a chair or eliminating a table in the corner).
  Weaknesses: May lack precision and occasionally overlook details.

Decision-Making Guide:
Based on the scene data, available methods, and specific requirements of the user’s prompt, choose the best method for the current iteration. The ideal method should balance speed, realism, controllability, and cost, depending on the specific problem you are aiming to solve.

If you need a foundational layout quickly, Method 1 offers the highest accuracy, while Method 2 provides greater flexibility and speed.
For unique or complex room types, Method 4 (Generated Scene with GPT) is ideal for creating a custom layout when other approaches fall short.
For detailed additions or partial scene enhancements, both Method 3 (Image Generation + 3D Reconstruction) and Method 4 (Generated Scene with GPT) are effective. Method 3 produces more realistic results, while Method 4 offers greater precision.
For object removal and layout modifications, Method 5 (Update Scene with GPT) is the best choice.
To achieve the best results, combine multiple methods over several iterations — start with a foundational layout and refine it progressively with finer details.

"""

# Method 5: Modify by rule
#   Data Prior: None
#   Use Case: Suitable for fine-tuning or making detailed modifications to specific objects within an existing scene.
#   Capabilities: Can add, remove, or move objects. Allows for modifying object relationships (positioning, constraints, etc.).
#   Strengths: Highly controllable for adjusting the scene layout and objects. Useful for precise, targeted edits. Also useful for adding objects inside a furniture randomly, such as adding books in the shelf.
#   Weaknesses: Not suitable for creating the scene from scratch or generating a foundational layout.

Current Scene:
{sceneinfo_prompt}
Describe the scene based on the provided image and the current data.

Analyze the scene and propose some improvements. You can consider the following factors:

Initial Scene Construction: If the scene is empty or lacks a foundational structure, what is the best method to generate a basic layout that fits the user's prompt (e.g., living room, office)?
Adding Furniture and Objects: If the scene feels sparse, assess whether more furniture needs to be added to the ground or corners, or if additional small objects should be placed on shelves, desks, or tables.
Detailing: Evaluate if the scene could benefit from small decorative items or functional objects placed inside or on top of furniture (e.g., books, lamps, plants).
Collision and Layout Issues: Check if there are any collisions or improper placements of objects that disrupt the flow of the room. Do any objects need repositioning or resizing for better usability or aesthetic?
User Prompt Satisfaction: Does the current scene meet the user's prompt requirements? What needs to be changed or added to align with the prompt more closely?
Realism Enhancement: What adjustments can be made to make the scene feel more realistic? Consider adding, removing, or repositioning objects to enhance visual harmony and authenticity.
Check Object: Check for any redundant or unnecessary objects that could be removed to streamline the scene.

Note: Do not add rugs on the ground or decorations on the wall. 
Make your choice based on which method will achieve the highest quality and efficiency in improving the scene while keeping the user's needs and constraints in mind.

Main Goal for the Next Iteration:
Identify the most crucial improvement that should be made in this iteration based on the Analysis. This should address the most pressing issue and make the biggest impact on the overall scene.

You may update the scene over multiple iterations, and you can select the most appropriate method(s) for each iteration. It’s often useful to leverage different methods in various iterations to make incremental improvements.

Recommended Approach & Method(s) for 5 Iterations:
You can consider using a sequence of methods that build on each other in multiple iterations. A sample approach could be:

Iteration 0: Use Method 1 or 2 to create a basic layout for the given scene type (if supported).
Iteration 1: Enhance the scene with Method 3 or 4, adding more details or making improvements based on the initial layout.
Iteration 2: Add more refinement and smaller details in specific areas (e.g., corners, objects on tables) using Method 3 or 4.
Iteration 3: Make fine-tuned modifications to specific objects using Method 5, focusing on layout adjustments and object removal.
Iteration 4: Everything is fine. Finish.
Try to avoid repeating the same method or actions in consecutive iterations.

  "Thoughts": "A solid and realistic starting point for the bedroom layout is crucial, so I should select a method that provides the most accurate and real representation of a bedroom. For this, Method 1 (real2sim indoor scene data) seems like the best option. This method can offer an accurate, data-driven layout of a typical bedroom, which will give us a solid base to work with.The other methods, such as Method 2 (scene synthesis by neural network), are also viable for providing a foundational layout, but Method 1 is a stronger choice due to its direct real-world data and higher realness.",
